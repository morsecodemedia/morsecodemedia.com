Due to the scalability of league, the number of teams and conferences varied from season to season. We took this into consideration, allowing admins to define the conferences and which teams were in each for each year. By using the teams' 'ids' as references, we were able to create a history of previous years, despite if a team didn't play certain years, or was zoned into a different conference.</p><p>The system also allowed for News and Video Library sections, complete with tag management. This tagging system allowed for relevant articles and videos to be dynamically pulled into the team pages as well.</p><p>Another new offering provided, was a portal for users to find out how to get involved with the league, as well as current members to be able to pay their membership dues.</p>",

We literally brought our latest campaign to life and invited hand surgeons to enter the interactive world of a patient with DC&mdash;the XIAFLEX<sup>&reg;</sup> \"garage.\" To help hand surgeons become more comfortable with using XIAFLEX<sup>&reg;</sup> and gain a deeper understanding of their patients' challenges, this garage provided several dynamic, self-navigated opportunities for training and learning.</p><p>iPads with preloaded modules offered individual on-the-spot training on treating with XIAFLEX<sup>&reg;</sup>, while touch panels peppered throughout the booth allowed hand surgeons to view clinical data and patient profiles. Hand surgeons could also step directly into their patients' shoes by wearing a special motorcycle glove we helped design that simulated what it feels like to have DC. They could even hop onto an actual motorcycle we parked in the booth.</p>",
